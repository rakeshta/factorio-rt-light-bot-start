## Light Bot Start

You didn't crash land on an alien planet with nothing. Fortunately you had a few bots with you to help you get started.

## Starting items

When you crash land into a new save, you find the following items in your inventory:

- A modular armour
- A par of MK1 roboports
- A few construction bots
- A few personal equipment batteries and solar panels

Following additional items can be added if you turn them on in the startup settings:

- Two stacks of cliff explosives
- Two stacks of landfill
- A car
