## Light Bot Start

You didn't crash land on an alien planet with nothing. Fortunately you had a few bots with you to help you get started.

## Starting items

When you crash land into a new save, you find the following items in your inventory:

- A modular armour
- A par of MK1 roboports
- A few construction bots
- A few personal equipment batteries and solar panels
